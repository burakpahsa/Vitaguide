# VitePress ðŸ’™ StackBlitz

Hi there :wave: This is a demo running VitePress within your **browser tab**!

## Powered by Vite

VitePress uses Vite under the hood. This means:

- Instant server start
- Lightning fast HMR
- Optimized builds

## Markdown-Centered

So you can focus more on writing. Powered by MarkdownIt. Comes with many [built-in extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown), and you can use Vue features in Markdown too!
[Home](/) <!-- sends the user to the root index.md -->
[foo](/foo/) <!-- sends the user to index.html of directory foo -->
[foo heading](./#heading) <!-- anchors user to a heading in the foo index file -->
[bar - three](../bar/three) <!-- you can omit extension -->
[bar - three](../bar/three.md) <!-- you can append .md -->
[bar - four](../bar/four.html) <!-- or you can append .html -->
